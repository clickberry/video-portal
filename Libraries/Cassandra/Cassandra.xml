               The serial consistency level is only used by conditional updates (so INSERT, UPDATE

            a conditional write has a regular consistency of QUORUM (and is successful), then a
            QUORUM read is guaranteed to see that write. But if the regular consistency of that
            write is ANY, then only a read with a consistency of SERIAL is guaranteed to see it

            <remarks>
                The driver auto-detect new Cassandra nodes added to the cluster through server side
                pushed notifications and through checking the system tables. For each node, the address
                the driver will receive will correspond to the address set as rpc_address in the node
                yaml file. In most case, this is the correct address to use by the driver and that is
                what is used by default. However, sometimes the addresses received through this
                mechanism will either not be reachable directly by the driver or should not be the
                prefered address to use to reach the node (for instance, the rpc_address set on
                Cassandra nodes might be a private IP, but some clients may have to use a public IP,
                or pass by a router to reach that node). This interface allows to deal with such cases,
                by allowing to translate an address as sent by a Cassandra node to another address
                to be used by the driver for connection.
                Please note that the contact points addresses provided while creating the
                <c>Cluster</c> instance are not "tanslated", only IP address retrieve from or sent
                by Cassandra nodes to the driver are.

            <summary>
             A retry policy that sometimes retry with a lower consistency level than the
             one initially requested. <p> <b>BEWARE</b>: This policy may retry queries
             using a lower consistency level than the one initially requested. By doing
             so, it may break consistency guarantees. In other words, if you use this
             retry policy, there is cases (documented below) where a read at
             <c>Quorum</c> may not see a preceding write at
             <c>Quorum</c>. Do not use this policy unless you have understood the
             cases where this can happen and are OK with that. It is also highly
             recommended to always wrap this policy into <see cref="T:Cassandra.LoggingRetryPolicy"/>
             to log the occurrences of such consistency break. </p><p> This policy : the same
             retries than the <link>DefaultRetryPolicy</link> policy. But on top of that,
             it also retries in the following cases: <ul> <li>On a read timeout: if the
             number of replica that responded is greater than one but lower than is
             required by the requested consistency level, the operation is retried at a
             lower consistency level.</li> <li>On a write timeout: if the operation is an
             <c>WriteType.UNLOGGED_BATCH</c> and at least one replica acknowledged
             the write, the operation is retried at a lower consistency level.
             Furthermore, for other operation, if at least one replica acknowledged the
             write, the timeout is ignored.</li> <li>On an unavailable exception: if at
             least one replica is alive, the operation is retried at a lower consistency
             level.</li> </ul> </p><p> The reasoning behind this retry policy is the following
             one. If, based on the information the Cassandra coordinator node returns,
             retrying the operation with the initially requested consistency has a change
             to succeed, do it. Otherwise, if based on these informations we know <b>the
             initially requested consistency level cannot be achieve currently</b>, then:
             <ul> <li>For writes, ignore the exception (thus silently failing the
             consistency requirement) if we know the write has been persisted on at least
             one replica.</li> <li>For reads, try reading at a lower consistency level
             (thus silently failing the consistency requirement).</li> </ul> In other
             words, this policy : the idea that if the requested consistency level cannot
             be achieved, the next best thing for writes is to make sure the data is
             persisted, and that reading something is better than reading nothing, even if
             there is a risk of reading stale data.</p>

            <summary>
             This is a second copy of the inner loop of decompressTags used when near the
             end of the input. The key difference is the reading of the trailer bytes. The
             fast code does a blind read of the next 4 bytes as an int, and this code
             assembles the int byte-by-byte to assure that the array is not over run. The
             reason this code path is separate is the if condition to choose between these
             two seemingly small differences costs like 10-20% of the throughput. I'm
             hoping in future' versions of hot-spot this code can be integrated into the
             main loop but for now it is worth the extra maintenance pain to get the extra
             10-20%.
